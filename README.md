## JPMorgan Chase & Company’s COiN – Contract Intelligence program

### Overview and Origin

JPMorgan Chase & Company (“JPMC”) was founded in 1799 and took on its current form when Chase Bank merged with J.P. Morgan in 2000.  As part of JMPC’s goal to automate routine activities in their products and services for employees and clients.  Of their nearly $10 billion technology budget, the company committed over $1billion was dedicated for such automation between 2015 and 2017.

In 2017 the bank implemented the COiN system.  This system automates the interpretation and analysis of legal documents, as JPMC creates nearly 12,000 of such contracts on an annual basis using over 360,000 hours of labor to service those contracts.  

### Business Activities

The bank was looking to reduce the time and error in servicing commercial loans and related agreements and COiN was intended to automate many of the manual tasks associated with loan servicing including agreement creation, filing and signing and registering documentation.  The intended customer was the bank itself and its clients to cut down on the time and money spent on the creation and servicing of commercial loans

Although JPMC is a financial institute, the application is more of a legal product since it reviews the loans against the law and various regulations.  The legal AI global software market was believed to be around $2 billion in  2022 and could be as high as $5 billion by the end of 2030.  This market includes any product that uses AI for advances in the legal field.  But the market for this specific system is JPMC and its clients/customers so a smaller and would be limited to JPMC’s technology budget.  

COiN runs on a machine learning system that's powered by a new private cloud network that the bank uses Natural Language Processing (NLP).  More specifically, a student research project states that:
> The software employs image recognition to identify patterns in these agreements. While JPMorgan has been tight-lipped about the details of the proprietary technology, the bank has stated that the algorithm uses unsupervised learning: by digesting data on the bank’s numerous contracts, it can identify and categorize repeated clauses.

### Landscape

The proliferation of electronic documents utilized in business started an exponential increase of documentation being created and stored by companies which led to a need for improved document management capabilities for companies and therefore to the lawyers who are required to ensure all documentation related to litigation is discovered, reviewed and produced.  

In the past 10-20 years many firms have entered the document review market including start-ups, legal firms, consulting firms and digital reproduction entities have entered the market.  JPMC has the advantage of producing these contract on a large scale and the contracts themselves are not very complex and do not vary much for each iteration.  A number of law firms are also attempting to move AI into already existing legal technology:  
* DL Piper is using AI to help them review documentation in M&A deals.  
* Reed Smith uses AI to review and extract concepts or items from contracts.  
* Other software firms such as LawGeex use AI for contract review and to point out problems with missing or unartfully crafted contract language, while others are attempting to add AI to existing document review platforms.

### Results

It appears that the results for JPMC have been mainly positive to date.  Using time, error detection and efficiency, the application has done well.   It now reviews in seconds thousands of contracts that used to take hundreds of thousands of hours.  The application identifies patterns and can extract specific data using machine learning that reduces error rates which increases efficiency.

It is difficult to measure JPMC’s technology against its financial competitors as the applications are usually internally made and used so difficult to find products being used by other financial institutions.  Also, the product is for internal use, unlike the applications offered by law firms and software companies as the apps are created to resell or for providing services for their customers – who may or may not have their own AI applications for certain parts of their processes.  In any event, given that JPMC has an advantage of having a huge repository of contracts and has incorporated not only their internal processes and workflows but those of their outside associations that assist in loan servicing and related services.  It also frees up their legal and other staff from routine and relatively unskilled work to devote to more appropriate and strategic work.

### Recommendations

JPMC is looking to put this technology to other uses – to do try other types of more complicated contracts and to eventually analyze legal interpretations and to review and interpret employee communications.  

I would recommend that they expand on their idea of analyzing communications and look toward analyzing all corporate records and to assist with the proper management of these records.  Proper management of these records would help to eliminate bad data and/or duplicate data from being stored in systems used by AI for information.  Record management, like contract writing, is a very labor intensive and AI should prove to be more effective than allowing personal from different departments and countries properly classify a record.  AI would also reduce risk in being consistent as people tend to classify records incorrectly since it is a very subjective exercise and perhaps AI would be able to compare a vast amount of records with the one at issue more efficiently and effectively.
